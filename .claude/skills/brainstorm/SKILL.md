# Brainstorm Skill
Run a 3-phase multi-agent brainstorm:
1. Explore the codebase for relevant context before each phase
2. Phase 1: Divergent exploration (3 perspectives)
3. Phase 2: Challenge assumptions (Devil's Advocate)
4. Phase 3: Converge on architecture and create GitHub issues
Always ground responses in actual codebase analysis.
